			<h2>A character sheet that remembers</h2>
			<p>(The character sheet I wanted didn't exist, so I built it)</p>
			<p>
				I got tired of being scared to respec or try new builds.
				So I made a character sheet with undo, branching, and a full history of every change.
				It's the tool I wanted but couldn't find.
			</p>
			<h3>Undo anything</h3>
			<p>Every change is saved. Picked the wrong feat at level 4? Just undo it. No need to rebuild from scratch or beg your DM to retcon.</p>
			<h3>Branch your build</h3>
			<p>Want to see if that Warlock dip is worth it? Create a branch, try it out, compare the two versions side by side. Keep whichever one feels better.</p>
			<h3>See your character's history</h3>
			<p>Your sheet isn't just your current statsâ€”it's a timeline. Review old versions, see what changed each level, remember who your character was three sessions ago.</p>
